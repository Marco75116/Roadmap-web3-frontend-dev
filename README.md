# Roadmap-web3-frontend-dev

Hi everyone ! 
 
I am Ourradour Marc-antoine Web3 front-end developer at Pyratzlabs. 
Working in the blockchain sector on a daily basis is very challenging cause it’s constantly in evolution. Blockchain job is also attractive it offers you a great opportunity to participate in innovative projects while earning a competitive  salary. Are you interested in learning about blockchain development? 
 Here is a comprehensive roadmap of resources that will help get you on the path to becoming an expert blockchain front-end developer.


Practice is important to master programming cause it allows you to search discover and use theoretical concepts. That will help you to develop problem-solving and logical thinking skills, as well as discover how to solve a problem. So code as much as you can my friend ! Having the desire is good, but coding is even better.

# Step 1: The First Step
Before diving into blockchain concepts, it’s important that you have a solid foundation of the basics of a web dev Html/css/js. You can easily get an overview of these technology afterwards, I advise you to go to <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/">Frontendmentor</a> and implement some templates. Because you will have to deal with a lot of complex data you have to improve your algorithmique skill by resolving challenge on <a href="https://www.codewars.com/">CodeWars</a>.

# Step2: Level Up
Now that you have a solid foundation it's time to level up your skills by using more powerful tools. Do this by using a strengh web development frameworks, such as <a href="https://beta.reactjs.org/">React</a>. React allows you to create reusable components, it optimizes updates and rendering of components, resulting in faster and smoother user experiences. React makes it easier to build and maintain complex applications. React is widely used in the blockchain industry, it’s profitabl it easier to find support when needed on stackExchange and stack overflow. 
In addition to React , it's also a good idea to familiarize yourself with a CSS framework, such as TailwindCSS or Styled Components. These frameworks provide a set of pre-designed CSS classes that you can use to quickly and easily style your app. 

To further enhance your projects and make them more professional, consider adding TypeScript, Prettier, ESLint and Git. TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that can help catch errors before runtime, making your development process more efficient. Prettier is a code formatter and esLint is a tool code analyser and reporter according instructions. They are useful for the team to maintain a code base that will follow a common pattern across the team. Finally Git, this version control system is essential to collaborate with others dev on a project. 

By learning these tools, you'll be able to build more complex and dynamic web applications, which will come in handy when you dive into blockchain development.


# Step3: Understanding Blockchain Technology
Gain a general understanding of the technology, its architecture, and its use cases. Familiarize yourself with blockchain concepts such as blocks, Web3, consensus algorithms, cryptography and smart contracts. As much you take to learn the concepts of blockchain easier it will be to implement a solution which interact with them later. You can do this by reading articles, watching videos or documentations. <a href="https://medium.com/search?q=blockchain">Medium</a> is full of quality articles, community has written of every concepts and subject related to blockchain, I’m pretty sure you'll find what you're looking for. On YouTube, there are animations with short explanations such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSo_EIwHSd4&list=PLzvRQMJ9HDiQF_5bEErheiAawrJ-2zQoI&index=17&ab_channel=SimplyExplained">SimplyExplained</a>. Don't hesitate to look at the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/learn/">Ethereum documentation</a>, it is complete and accessible in your preferred language.


# Step4: Tech approach
It's time to dive deeper into the technical aspects of blockchain development. You will deal with components that make up a blockchain network. So you have to read entirely the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/">glossaire of ethereum</a>, cause it’s mandatory to know what is a gwei, a transaction, events, abi and much more. Look on oppenzellin for the two most famous standards ERC20(corner) & ERC721(NFT) to understand and how to handle them.
Download metamask extension and create a wallet and use with historical protocols such as Aave, Uniswap & Opensea. In addition to playing with these protocols go check your transactions on an explorer and find the concepts you have seen previously. After reading a lot, let’s interact « directly » with the blockchain , Ethers library will allow us to read and modify data of the blockchain. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk7nVp5HTCk&ab_channel=DappUniversity">Ethers tutorial</a> follow this tutorial, it is very clear and skills of ethers are well split up. It will guide you through the ethers setup, retrieving account Balances, Read Smart Contracts, make an eth transfer, write smart contract. Note that the tutorial uses kovan testnet which is deprecated, use Goerli testnet now, <a href="https://goerlifaucet.com/">Faucet Goerli</a>. Afterward close the youtube window and use those ther skills to build your own react applications which is able to connect with metamask, to display data and run transactions.

# Step5: Professional skills
Congratulations, you now have solid skills as a blockchain front-end developer. <Br/> 
As you may noticed, it is very difficult to read anything other than basic data directly from the blockchain. All dapps related to complex smart contracts query data from an indexer. At each transaction an event is emitted, the indexer will catch it, process it and store it. Thanks to the indexer, we are able to display data filtered and sorted easily, like display activities from a specific account. The most used indexer is <a href="https://thegraph.com/en/"> TheGraph</a>, you should be familiar with graphql. At least you need to know <a href="https://thegraph.com/docs/en/querying/querying-from-an-application/">how to query data</a> to interact with <a href="https://thegraph.com/explorer">subgraphs currently published</a>. Choose a subgraph of a famous protocol and create your ultimate dapp based on everything you have learned. One last thing, check <a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a> & <a href="https://www.cypress.io/">Cypress</a>, it allow you to create unit & end to end tests easily for your dapp. Although this is an additional task, the tests save time by helping you to catch regressions early before they cause problems. <Br/> 
If you’ve finish this Roadmap, if you have understood & master on every technologies you should	feel incredibly proud of yourself. 

# Conclusion
Becoming an expert blockchain front-end developer takes dedication and hard work but if you stay focused and keep up-to-date with new implementations in the industry then there are plenty of exciting opportunities available for those who pursue them! With this comprehensive roadmap of resources at your disposal, we hope that you feel inspired and empowered to begin your journey towards becoming an expert blockchain developer today! Good luck and don’t forget just do it!
